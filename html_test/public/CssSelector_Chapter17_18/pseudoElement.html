    <p>If not to the sun for smiling, warm is still in the sun there, but wewill laugh more confident calm;
        if turned to found his own shadow, appropriate escape, the sun will be through the heart,warm each place behind the corner;
        if an outstretched palm cannot fall butterfly, then clenched waving arms, given power;
        if I can't have bright smile, it will face to the sunshine, and sunshine smile together, in full bloom.</p>
